README

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled "numpy.ipynb" that provides an introduction to the basics of NumPy, which is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. The Notebook covers the following topics:

1. Introduction to NumPy arrays
2. Creating NumPy arrays
3. Indexing and Slicing NumPy arrays
4. NumPy array operations and broadcasting
5. Linear algebra operations with NumPy
6. Random sampling with NumPy
7. The Notebook includes detailed explanations of each topic, accompanied by code examples that illustrate how to perform the different operations using NumPy.

# Getting Started
To use the Notebook, you will need to have Python installed on your computer, as well as Jupyter Notebook. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Jupyter Notebook can be installed using pip or Anaconda.

Once you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, you can download or clone the repository to your local machine. Open the "numpy.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells to see the results of the operations.
